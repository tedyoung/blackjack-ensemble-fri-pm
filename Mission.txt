# Mission/Goals

## Current Feature

1. Multiple simultaneous Games (multiple games of single players vs. dealer)

    [X] Add intermediary: GameService, all commands/queries go through the service
    [>>] Assign IDs to Game: have all GET/POST include that ID
         Next Step: in BlackjackController:
            (in GameService, startGame could be renamed createGame?)
            * Stop using hard-coded 42L for the id for "current game"
            -> transition to Game created upon startGame, figure out how to make currentGame work
            ---> push the constant out to the callers (test)
            -> goal is to get rid of currentGame and replace it with gameFor(id)
            use the ID in redirect (returned from the POST) and as input from GET requests
    [ ] Use the ID with a GameRepository (in-memory) to load/store the multiple games
        Refactor/extract from GameService
    [ ] If desired, use real database

## Other Feature Options
