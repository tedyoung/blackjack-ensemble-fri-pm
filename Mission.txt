# Mission/Goals

## Options

1. Multiple simultaneous Games (multiple games of single players vs. dealer)

    [X] Add intermediary: GameService, all commands/queries go through the service
    [>>] Assign IDs to Game: have all GET/POST include that ID
         Currently broken: in the process of passing Deck to GameService so it can create a Game with the proper Deck
    [ ] Use the ID with a GameRepository (in-memory) to load/store the multiple games
    [ ] If desired, use real database

2. Add Betting support
3. Support multiple players (one dealer, multiple players)
4. Persist games to database (requires #2)
