# Mission/Goals

## Current Feature

1. Multiple simultaneous Games (multiple games of single players vs. dealer)

    [X] Add intermediary: GameService, all commands/queries go through the service
    [>>] Assign IDs to Game: have all GET/POST include that ID
         Next Step: in BlackjackController/GameService:
           --> Add ID to POST URL in the HTML's action
            -> Make all POST handlers use the incoming ID (from the URL)

            -> Eventually, stop using the field `gameId` in the BlackjackController to hold onto a Game ID
            (push the constant out of GameService to the caller)

            -> goal is to get rid of currentGame and replace it with gameFor(id)
            use the ID in redirect (returned from the POST) and as input from GET requests
                -> GET to /done needs game ID
    [ ] Use the ID with a GameRepository (in-memory) to load/store the multiple games
        Refactor/extract from GameService
    [ ] If desired, use real database
