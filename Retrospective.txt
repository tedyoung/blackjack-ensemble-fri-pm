Retrospective: Ensemble FRI-PM #7 (May 20, 2022)
------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Nice to read through tests after refactoring to see that they still make sense, no duplication
    Nice to relax the driver/navigator and do some things (test review) in the Huddle
        Good to have more opinions for that kind of work
        Nice to reduce/eliminate some redundant assertions on the redirect
            Using the manual mutation testing to see what tests would fail and evaluate: keep or remove assertion
    It‚Äôs hard to avoid jumping to making big changes vs. smaller steps
    Extract methods and then form a new class vs. create the new class and find out what to move
        Fix Primitive Obsession
    Nice start on the Repository: refactor our way to it
        Hex Arch reminds us where things go
    When confused and you figure it out, make it so that you won‚Äôt be confused the same way in the future
        Not always easy
Learnings
    Navigation: announce ‚ÄúLeft‚Äù or ‚ÄúRight‚Äù pane instead of the name of the class, so the Driver knows more quickly what you‚Äôre talking about
    Navigator: start with high-level intent, only provide more details when Driver needs them

Retrospective: Ensemble FRI-PM #6 (May 13, 2022)
------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    New network cable needed
    Nice to see the feature completed!
        Surprise, we‚Äôre done!
            Can be anti-climatic
        And see partially done along the way vs. not working at all until it‚Äôs all done
        Lots of fun refactorings along the way
        Feature: see all completed games and/or in-progress games
    Going back to the code and tests to review for clean up and possibly more refactoring was useful
    Changed goal for what I thought we would modify after explaining it the second time
        Having the idea flow through multiple people‚Äôs heads does
            We catch differences in understanding
            We come to better solutions and understanding
    Noticed that we‚Äôre missing Object Protocol constraints in Player and Hand
        Which universe are we in?
Learnings
    Commit using IJ via CMD+K
        Two choices: modal or tool window


Retrospective: Ensemble FRI-PM #5 (May 6, 2022)
-----------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Controller testing at a distance instead of testing closer to the object that is doing the work we‚Äôre actually testing
        This is part of the process, as long as you do the refactoring part
    Soumya was our only committer!
    Taking larger steps instead of smaller
        Thinking about the smallest next step we can take
    Writing code before tests is a hard habit to break
    Cleaning up our tests!
    Sometimes tests didn‚Äôt break when we added parameter to service methods
        Indicates missing tests?
    Try out more refactorings! Just try it!
        Experiment!
    Cleaned up new line/whitespace formatting in tests
    Cleaned up unused fields
Learnings
    Learning about the Spring MVC flow and Models
    ‚Äúany var‚Äù in the Change Signature refactoring
    CTRL+N for Class and then CTRL+SHIFT+N for File and CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+N
    CTRL+SHIFT+A for Action
    F2 navigate to next ‚Äúerror‚Äù or ‚Äúwarning"
Next Time
    Commit more often
        As ‚Äúsave‚Äù points
        Helps focus on one thing at a time
    Code coverage for guidance on missing tests
    Close the TEST RUN tool window: if the tests pass, close it
    Close the Terminal when you‚Äôre done
    Code Inlay Hints: Code Vision - show usages, do NOT show committer
    Driver has permission to ‚Äútidy up‚Äù

Retrospective: Ensemble FRI-PM #4 (April 15, 2022)
--------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Prep machine for Ensemble
        +1
    Got distracted: not sure what to focus on as there were several options
    Making current direction clear
    Forgetting is NORMAL
    Higher level goal was clear
    Made progress forward
    Non-trivial API change, trying to take small steps is hard!
    Detective Work: read the WHOLE stack trace
        Make sure it‚Äôs clear what the problem is before trying to solve it
Learnings
    What was ‚ÄúassertThatThrownBy‚Äù again?
Next Time
    Update IntelliJ IDEA
    (When Ted says: re-clone and re-create the project)
    Feel free to request Huddle time
    Introduce ID generator via extract method -> move to class -> make injectable

Retrospective: Ensemble FRI-PM #3 (April 8, 2022)
-------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Interesting. ü§î
    Started out in the wrong direction, then after a full round, started over
    Hadn‚Äôt finished GameService ‚Äúthought‚Äù and wasn‚Äôt ready to be used properly
    A nice break when test fixes were mechanical
    Identifying the right time to take a step back can be hard
    Undoing ‚Äúmanually‚Äù is hard
    Hard to do ‚Äúbig‚Äù changes in small steps
        Very tempting to just make the bigger change all at once
        Do the big change and then revert it and try to do it in smaller steps
    Fixing test without understanding the true cause of the problem doesn‚Äôt always work
Learnings
Next Time
    More explicit commits to provide ‚Äúsave/revert‚Äù points


Retrospective: Ensemble FRI-PM #2 (April 1, 2022)
-------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Went blank first round, a little strange feeling
    Failing Integration Test at the start of our Ensemble and was failing at the end
    Taking too big of a step can result in tests passing before they fail - going right to HashMap for the Game instead of smaller step of using Game field
        Was good that we recognized it and took a step back
Learnings
    Lots of shortcuts
        Take a little time to practice
        Cursor movement
        Selection
Next Time
    Can we: Default to not use ‚Äòvar‚Äô for Extract Variable


Retrospective: Ensemble FRI-PM #1 (March 25, 2022)
--------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    When took one step too far, TDD is about tiny little steps
        It‚Äôs not easy to identify those small steps!!
        Decided to fix the other tests that we broke, perhaps could have done something else?
            We could! So we went back and (sort of) tried again.
    New to the codebase, even though we‚Äôve seen it before (memory fades!)
        The Ensemble will help remember for us (crowdsourced memory)
Learnings
    Lots of new stuff: IDE, language
    mob.sh is really cool!
