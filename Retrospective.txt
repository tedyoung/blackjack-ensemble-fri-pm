Retrospective: Ensemble FRI-PM #3 (April 8, 2022)
-------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Interesting. ü§î
    Started out in the wrong direction, then after a full round, started over
    Hadn‚Äôt finished GameService ‚Äúthought‚Äù and wasn‚Äôt ready to be used properly
    A nice break when test fixes were mechanical
    Identifying the right time to take a step back can be hard
    Undoing ‚Äúmanually‚Äù is hard
    Hard to do ‚Äúbig‚Äù changes in small steps
        Very tempting to just make the bigger change all at once
        Do the big change and then revert it and try to do it in smaller steps
    Fixing test without understanding the true cause of the problem doesn‚Äôt always work

Next Time
    More explicit commits to provide ‚Äúsave/revert‚Äù points


Retrospective: Ensemble FRI-PM #2 (April 1, 2022)
-------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Went blank first round, a little strange feeling
    Failing Integration Test at the start of our Ensemble and was failing at the end
    Taking too big of a step can result in tests passing before they fail - going right to HashMap for the Game instead of smaller step of using Game field
        Was good that we recognized it and took a step back
Learnings
    Lots of shortcuts
        Take a little time to practice
        Cursor movement
        Selection
Next Time
    Can we: Default to not use ‚Äòvar‚Äô for Extract Variable


Retrospective: Ensemble FRI-PM #1 (March 25, 2022)
--------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    When took one step too far, TDD is about tiny little steps
        It‚Äôs not easy to identify those small steps!!
        Decided to fix the other tests that we broke, perhaps could have done something else?
            We could! So we went back and (sort of) tried again.
    New to the codebase, even though we‚Äôve seen it before (memory fades!)
        The Ensemble will help remember for us (crowdsourced memory)
Learnings
    Lots of new stuff: IDE, language
    mob.sh is really cool!
