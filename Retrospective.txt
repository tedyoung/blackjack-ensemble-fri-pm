Retrospective: Ensemble FRI-PM #2 (April 1, 2022)
-------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Went blank first round, a little strange feeling
    Failing Integration Test at the start of our Ensemble and was failing at the end
    Taking too big of a step can result in tests passing before they fail - going right to HashMap for the Game instead of smaller step of using Game field
        Was good that we recognized it and took a step back
Learnings

Retrospective: Ensemble FRI-PM #1 (March 25, 2022)
--------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    When took one step too far, TDD is about tiny little steps
        It’s not easy to identify those small steps!!
        Decided to fix the other tests that we broke, perhaps could have done something else?
            We could! So we went back and (sort of) tried again.
    New to the codebase, even though we’ve seen it before (memory fades!)
        The Ensemble will help remember for us (crowdsourced memory)
Learnings
    Lots of new stuff: IDE, language
    mob.sh is really cool!
